Box Model : In CSS, the box model is a fundamental concept that describes how elements are structured and how their dimensions are calculated. Every HTML element can be considered as a box, which consists of several layers:

1. Content: The innermost layer, which contains the actual content of the element (text, images, etc.).
2. Padding: The space between the content and the border. It creates a buffer around the content.
3. Border: A line that surrounds the padding (if any) and content. It can be styled with different colors, widths, and styles.
4. Margin: The outermost layer, which creates space between the element and other elements on the page.

Understanding the box model is crucial for effective layout design and element spacing in web development.
